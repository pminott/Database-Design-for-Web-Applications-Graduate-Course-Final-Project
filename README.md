# Database Design for Web Applications Graduate Course Final Project
Must use the insertValues and Mass_Geekery SQL files to populate the databases.

I am building a social media site called “Mass Geekery”. The purpose of this site is to connect fans of science fiction, gaming, graphic novels and animated television to one another. Users would be either a member or admin. This specific project will focus on the design and implementation of the members’ sign-up process and private message system. (In depth information can be found in the Project_Summary.docx.)

Highlights:
•	Utilizes HTML, CSS and Bootstrap framework to develop and design front-end user interface
•	Developed, implemented and designed MySQL database as well as system’s use case scenarios 
•	Utilizes phpMyAdmin to update database via SQL scripts
•	PHP scripts utilized SQL to query and update the database
